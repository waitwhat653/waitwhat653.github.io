        Nobody’s <em>born</em> smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and <em>fail</em> and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until <em>one</em> day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a <strong>little bit stronger.</strong><br>
        <em>Failing</em> is just another word for <strong><em>growing.</em></strong> And you keep going.<br>
        <em><strong>This. is. learning.</strong></em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, <em>yet.</em>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts<br>in the whole wide universe
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        <em><strong>Whoever you are, wherever you are.</strong></em><br>
        </p>
        <p>
        <em><strong>You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.</strong></em>
